\section{Functional Requirements Evaluation}

\noindent The following table suggests examples of system level tests that were executed in order to verify that the functional requirements of the system were met.

		ST1 & Check "Current Source" radio button & Current Source is reset & PASS &\\ \hline
		ST2 & Type an integer (1) in the "Current Supply" textbox and click "Set" button & Current Supply is set to 1mA and displayed & PASS &\\ \hline
		ST3 & Type an integer (10) in the "Compliance" textbox and click "Set" button & Compliance voltage is set to 10V & PASS & Compliance voltage is shown on the Keithley current source display \\ \hline

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
