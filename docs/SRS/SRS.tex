This document describes the software requirements for the capstone project of measuring microstructure changes of samples during thermal treatment. The template for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template.


\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to assist the Department of Materials Engineering in measuring the changes to a material's microstructure during thermal treatment. 
By doing so, the resistivity of the sample can be measured at different thermal levels. The goal is to be able to collect the data at necessary sampling rate and 
incorporate the use of Windows GUI. 

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{Developers}
The Developers will be responsible for the design, development, and documentation throughout. They will be utilizing the existing lab equipment, computer for the duration of this project.
Developers will also use the feedback from the client to deliver the final product. 

\subsubsection{The Client}
The Client for this project is the Department of Materials Engineering and the Computing and Software Department at McMaster University. More specifically, Dr. Zurob, Dr. Smith and TAs of 4G06 who will be the ones to evaluate, review and provide feedback on the project throughout the development process.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The Customers for this project are anyone who will be conducting research or require data that measures the microstructural changes of materials under various thermal treatment.   

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
This project has no other stakeholders.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}

Description: The GUI will run on Windows operating system\\ 
Rationale: The application is a Desktop application. The lab computer that has the capability to connect to other required lab equipment currently runs on Windows.\\
Fit Criterion: Users can successfully install and open the application on a supported Windows operating system. \\

\noindent Description: The sampling rate of the equipment to the GUI will be at least 100 times per second\\ 
Rationale: According to Dr.Zurob, this is the minimum sampling rate needed to see any meaningful data\\
Fit Criterion: The equipment samples the data at 100 times per second and the GUI accurately reflects the measurements  \\

\subsubsection{Off-the-shelf Software}
No off-the-shelf software is required for this project. 

\subsubsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The software and equipment will be designed for the expected environment of a lab. The reason is that the lab equipment and computer is needed for the software to run successfully and
should not be easily accessible outside of campus. 

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
% Add other deadlines
The deadline for the final product is the March 20 2023. There will be other milestones during the development process that must be accomplished throughout. 
This will be outlined in our Github milestones.


\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
% Double check this
At this point, there is an estimated budget of \$1000. This may change as the team determines what additional equipment is needed to work with the lab equipment.

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{JavaScript}: Scripting language used to create and control dynamic content.
    \item \textbf{HTML}: Standard markup language for creating web pages.
    \item \textbf{CSS}: Style sheet language for structuring and styling HTML web page.
    \item \textbf{Windows}: A popular operating system used by many users.
    \item \textbf{Product/Software/Application}: Refers to the final deliverable of this capstone project.
    \item \textbf{User}: The person who will be interacting/ using the application.
    \item \textbf{Electron}: JavaScript framework used to develop Desktop applications.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsubsection{Facts}
The client and control computer is using Windows 7 operating system that is questionably upgradable and it is worth mentioning that Windows 7 is currently unsupported. The equipment for power supply and measurement tools are outdated and require special connection media, both physical connections and drivers, to communicate with the computer. There exists an application with a similar purpose and function to our projectâ€™s on the computer, which does not fulfill the goals of the user anymore, and the source code for that application is not provided.

Resistivity of a sample material is calculated by the following equation. Where $\rho$ is the resistivity, R is the resistance, A is the cross-sectional area, and L is the length of the sample:
$ \rho = \frac{RA}{L} $
% Include a couple sentences about the background and maybe an equation describing how the conductivity is calculated.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
Statement: It is assumed that materials will have microstructural changes when they undergo heat treatment. 
Effect: In case this assumption is false, our product will display no output. 

Statement: Another assumption is that these microstructural changes will result in changes in resistivity of the materials treated. 
Effect: If this assumption is false, the product will be rendered unsuitable for the task as the main function of it is to measure changes in resistivity.

Statement: According to the project timeline, it is assumed that a proof of concept will be ready by November 14th, a first functional design will be ready by February 6th, and a final revision will be demoed by March 31st.
Effect: These dates are made to observe progress of the project. In case the final demo is not met, the project will have been incomplete, since that will be the end of term for the developers.
% Include a couple sentences about any assumptions that we have

\subsubsection{User Characteristics}
An assumption made about this project is that the users will have the necessary knowledge to safely operate the necessary lab equipment. This is required to collect the data and display it on the GUI. 
The user is also assumed to have general working knowledge of how to install and open a windows application, as well as the use of a mouse and keyboard input. Another assumption is that the user is literate in English.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

The hardware for this project is provided by the Department of Materials Engineering through the project supervisor, Dr. Zurob. A Windows computer, current source, and nanovoltmeter have already been included. A fourth hardware device, for measuring the temperature of the sample material, will also be provided or else a new device shall be purchased for this purpose. The product will be a Window's based GUI application which can set the data acquisition rate (sample rate), connect to the hardware devices, acquire the output data, and calculate the conductivity of the sample material in real time. The application should also be able to be accessed remotely to check on the progress of ongoing experiments. \\

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
% What are some issues we have right now

ADD SOME TEXT HERE

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
The application will use Electron, a JavaScript framework that allows developers to create cross-platform compatible desktop applications. 
Since the use cases of this project are more specialized, there are not many existing solutions available on the market.

\subsubsection{Ready Made Components}
The application will use existing libraries in Electron to further support the communcation with any equipment in the lab.

\subsection{New Problems}
 A potential problem from our product that may arise is the user's ability to learn the software.
  \subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
This product introduces a new learning curve for the user to use the application. 
To minimize this problem, the product will be implemented with a quick start guide and developers will design a user friendly interface.


\subsection{Tasks}
% What do we need to do?
% Communicate lab equipment output to some kind of communication channel (serial port, sockets, named pipes)
% Read data from the communication channel
% Create a GUI that can be installed and run on Windows 7
ADD STUFF HERE 

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
N/A

\subsection{Risks}
A risk to this project is that the current lab computer uses Windows 7 as its operating system. Although Electron has compatiblity with Windows 7, there appears to be a few issues in the past on GitHub. 
In the case that it does not work, the operating system will have to be upgraded to Windows 10 and the compatibility with the lab equipment is uncertain. Additionally, McMaster University had notified the 
Department of Materials Engineering that Windows 7 is no longer supported but since the lab computer does not require any network connections, it has remained running Windows 7. This poses a future risk of 
the operating system being forcefully upgraded.\\

Another risk is that the lab equipment does not offer the necessary sampling or is not compatible with the lab computer. 

\subsection{Costs}
The largest estimated cost of this project is time. It will require both the developers and the client's time to work and evaluate the project throughout.
Additional expense may be added if additional or new lab equipment is required. 

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
A main README file will be created and documented for information such as installation, system requirements, and available features. 
An additional safety document will also be created for users, before using any of the lab equipment. 

\subsection{Waiting Room}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requiring the highest possible rate of output.
    \item Requiring the software to work on the latest (supported) version of Windows.
    \item The option of using the application remotely.
    \item The option of using the application on different platforms, operating systems, devices, and with different input and measurement tools.
    \item Ability of the system to be a real-time system where it is used concurrently with the heat treatment process of materials, connected to the heat treatment systems and controlling them, measuring changes in real time and making decisions on the fly.
    \item Incorporation of machine learning and artificial intelligence in order to analyse data within processes and making adjustments to the treatment for customized optimal results.
    \item Addition of other methods of measurement of microstructural change; like adding high speed electronic microscopes with slow motion capture for manual or automated analysis on the physical outputs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reflections}

\noindent Q1: What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete this capstone project? \\
% Examples of possible knowledge to acquire include domain-specific knowledge from the domain of your application, 
% software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or computer science knowledge. 
% Skills may be related to technology, writing, presentation, team management, etc. You should look to identify at least one item for each team member.
\noindent Q2: For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or mastering the skill? 
From the identified approaches, which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice?\\

\noindent Response


Timothy - We need to acquire the knowledge and skills on developing a Window application using the Electron as the framework. One of the main requirements
from the supervisor is that it has to work on Windows operating system. In my experience through Co-op and school work, I have 
yet to interact with Window applications. This knowledge will hope us meet the requirements set by the supervisor as well 
as learning a new technical skill. 

There are a few approaches to acquiring this knowledge. The first way would be to look for blogs from other developers and learn from there
examples. The second way would be to watch and read tutorials online. The third way would be to read the documentation and conduct research. Lastly, 
we could also learn by trial and error. The approach I will be taking will be watching and reading tutorials online as they will be able to explain 
concepts in a simpler form with visual aids. This will help me gain knowledge in this concept and 
make it a skill I can gain from this project.
