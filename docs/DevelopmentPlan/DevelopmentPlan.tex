\maketitle

\indent The evolution of the material’s microstructure during thermal treatment can be followed by measuring changes to the electrical conductivity of the material. The electrical conductivity is measured using a four-point probe. A current source provides a small current that passes through the material and a nano-voltmeter measures the voltage. Using the current and voltage values, the resistance can be calculated. This can in turn be converted to conductivity if the dimensions of the sample are known. The goal of this project is to develop a Window’s based App which can be used to measure the conductivity. A current source and a nano- voltmeter will be provided. The App needs to connect to these devices and calculate the conductivity. The user should be able to control the acquisition rate as well as output the data (plots and text files). The equipment should operate under constant current and delta (current pulse) control.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
