\section{Introduction}

% [Include references to your other documentation â€”SS]

\noindent This document outlines the design and implementation plan for ReSprint's system that would be measuring and analyzing data from thermally treated samples. The main risks identified for the project include insufficient data sampling rates from existing measurement hardware and compatibility issues with the outdated operating system on the control computer. To mitigate these risks, the system will aim to be compatible with newer versions of Windows, be able to read and parse data files, perform extensive calculations, and handle real-time data processing. The project will be developed using C\#\ and the Microsoft Visual Studio environment, with ESLint as the linting tool and MochaJS as the unit testing framework as found in the \href{https://github.com/edwin-do/capstoneTeam30/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{Verification \&\ Validation Plan}. The system boundaries and components found in the \href{https://github.com/edwin-do/capstoneTeam30/docs/HazardAnalysis/HazardAnalysis.pdf}{Hazard Analysis} document include thermally treated samples, a current source, a temperature sensor, a nanovoltmeter, interfaces between the devices and control computer, the control computer, and the software application installed on the control computer. \\

\section{Purpose}

% \wss{Purpose of your design documentation}

% \wss{Point to your other design documents}

\noindent The purpose of the system design document for this project is to provide a detailed and comprehensive plan for the design and implementation of the hardware and electrical components of the project, following the successful completion of the proof of concept demonstration. As outlined in the \href{https://github.com/edwin-do/capstoneTeam30/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{Software Requirements and Specification} document, this document will add details to the technical requirements and constraints of the system, including any necessary measurements and interfaces as mentioned in the \href{https://github.com/edwin-do/capstoneTeam30/blob/main/docs/HazardAnalysis/HazardAnalysis.pdf}{Hazard Analysis} document. The document will serve as a guide for the development team in terms of the technical aspects of the project, including the necessary hardware and electrical components, and also acts as a reference for stakeholders, including any regulatory bodies, to understand the technical details of the project and ensure compliance with the \href{https://github.com/edwin-do/capstoneTeam30/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan} documentation. This document will be essential for the proper planning, development, and implementation of the hardware and electrical components of the project. \\

\section{Scope}

% \wss{Include a figure that show the System Context (showing the boundary between your system and the environment around it.)}

\noindent The scope of this document includes a comprehensive design plan for the hardware and electrical components of the project. It covers the purpose and scope of the project, an overview of the normal behavior and handling of undesired events, a component diagram, and a connection between requirements and design. The document also includes details on the system variables, including monitored, controlled, and constant variables, as well as the design of the user interfaces. Additionally, the document covers the design of the hardware, electrical components, and communication protocols, with a timeline for the project, and appendices on the interface, hardware, electrical components, communication protocols, and reflection on the project.

\section{Project Overview}

\subsection{Normal Behaviour}

\noindent The normal behavior and operation of the system refers to how the system is expected to function under normal operating conditions. This includes the system's ability to collect, process, and analyze data from thermally treated samples using the existing hardware, such as the nanovoltmeter, current source, and temperature sensor. The system should also be able to communicate with these devices using the appropriate communication protocols and interfaces, and handle any data synchronization issues. Additionally, the system should be able to perform basic calculations on the data and display it in an easy-to-understand format for the user. The system should also be able to handle real-time data processing, allowing for real-time monitoring of the samples. Overall, the normal behavior of the system is to provide accurate and reliable data analysis of thermally treated samples in real-time, allowing the user to make informed decisions based on the data provided. \\

\subsection{Undesired Event Handling}

% \wss{How you will approach undesired events}

\noindent In the event of an unexpected occurrence, the application should quickly transition to a safe state to prevent the acceptance of any invalid data by the system. This will avoid additional errors when the user accesses or alters corrupted or incorrect data. To ensure that all of the measurements expected are retrieved, the system shall make sure to notify the user to double-check the measurement devices and connectivity in case of failure. This approach will ensure that the system remains reliable and provides accurate data to the user. \\

\subsection{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

% \wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made
%  ``between'' the requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements,
%  design decisions need to be made.  Rather than make these decisions implicit,
%  they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a program has security
%  requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
%  requirements with a password.}
