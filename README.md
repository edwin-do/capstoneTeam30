# ReSprint

Developer Names: Abdul Nour Seddiki, Edwin Do, Joseph Braun, Timothy Chen, Tyler Magarelli

Supervisor: Dr. Hatem Zurob

Date of project start: Sept 01, 2022

This project is a revision of an application used by the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. The purprose of the application is to measure changes in a material's microstructure during thermal treatment. This can be done by looking at the changes in conductivity in real-time as a sample undergoes thermal treatment. The changes can occur very quickly and it is crucialfor the application to read real-time data at a sufficient acquisition rate.

## Motivation

The application was created to replace the previous implementation of the application as the  previous implementation failed to run at higher sampling rate. The prevous application was also lost in the process of upgrade the hardware. 

## Build Status

Application has been deployed. Initial requirements and features requested by the supervisor has been fulfilled.

## Tech/Framework
- C#

## Fearures
- Remote Access
- Live Graph

## Installation
