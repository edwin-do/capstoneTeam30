This project is a revision of an application used by the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. The purprose of the application is to measure changes in a material's microstructure during thermal treatment. This can be done by looking at the changes in conductivity in real-time as a sample undergoes thermal treatment. The changes can occur very quickly and it is crucialfor the application to read real-time data at a sufficient acquisition rate.
